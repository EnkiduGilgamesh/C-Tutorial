C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, whereas C is a procedure-oriented programming (POP) language, which makes C++ easiler to realize some complex projects.

Also, with the plenty of similarilies in grammar between C and C++, in this tutorial, I will only notice the differences and new characteristics in C++ from C.
